## Getting Started

1. App layout and calendar image will resemble the weather at a particular location.
2. App will start by cycling to random places in the world every 5 seconds (Purpose: wallpaper). You can pause this cycle with the button on the bottom.
3. You can search for a specific place by city or country if you want the capital.
4. You can choose different dates up until 2 days from now to see the forecast 
5. You can change from celsius to fahrenheit. This will also change the units for wind speed from kph to mph
6. Have fun exploring the weather around the world!
